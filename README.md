### A short DataCamp project for [Clustering Antarctic Penguin Species](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/projects/1809)

The dataset is available in the data folder as `penguins.csv`

**Origin of this data** : Data were collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER, a member of the Long Term Ecological Research Network.

**The dataset consists of 5 columns.**

Column | Description
--- | ---
culmen_length_mm | culmen length (mm)
culmen_depth_mm | culmen depth (mm)
flipper_length_mm | flipper length (mm)
body_mass_g | body mass (g)
sex | penguin sex

<i>Unfortunately, they have not been able to record the species of penguin, but they know that there are **at least three** species that are native to the region: **Adelie**, **Chinstrap**, and **Gentoo**.  The task is to help them identify groups in the dataset.<i>
